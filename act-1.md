# Find a Zine Template on Canva

In this exercise, you will create a zine using Canva. If you have any questions or get stuck, please ask your instructor for assistance. 

1.  Create a Canva account at 
[canva.com](https://ww.canva.com/){:target="_blank"}  <img src="images/01.png" alt="new slide" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;">
2.  Click on the Create a design button on the top right of the screen.  <img src="images/02.png" alt="new slide" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;">
    - In the search field, type the word "zine" and click on one of the size options (likely all the same). 
    - This will bring up a blank page with a list of zine templates on the left side.
3. Choose a template: <img src="images/04.png" alt="new slide" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:10px;">
   - You should have templates showing in the left sidebar with a Search field at the top. You can scroll down through the options until you see one that interests you. If you mouse over the cover image of one and hold your mouse pointer there, a preview of the other page layouts in that template will scroll by if available. 
   - Templates that are only available with a Pro account will have a small crown icon in the lower right corner. 
    - Once you find a template you like, click on it. If it has multiple pages, it will ask if you want to apply the other pages. We recommend you click the “apply both/all pages” button. You can discard the extra pages when you are finished designing your zine. (Alternatively, you can just add individual page layouts one at a time. Clicking on one will add it to your current blank page.)

4.  Customize the template: <img src="images/06.png" alt="new slide menu" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:10px;">
    -   Click on the arrow at the top of the left sidebar next to the template title to get back into the templates menu. 
    -   Click on the Styles tab. Make sure the Search field is empty. In this new sidebar menu there are various helpful tools for designing your zine. <img src="images/07.png" alt="new slide menu" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:10px;">
    
      <button onclick="toggle('gif1')">Show / Hide Animation </button>
<div id="gif1">
      <img src="images/canva-pp1.gif">
      </div>
      
5.  Font Sets:
    -   Clicking on “see all in “Font Sets” will bring up various font combinations Canva suggests together,  with 1-3 fonts (sometimes one font will have different variations within the same font, e.g., light and bold). <img src="images/08.png" alt="new slide menu" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:10px;">
    -   You can click on them to apply them to your design and the largest font will be set to your titles or heading, the medium font to your sub-headings, and the smallest to your body text. You can click through various sets to see how this changes the feel of your poster.
  
6.  Color Palettes:<img src="images/09.png" alt="new slide menu" style="float:right;width:200px;margin-left:10px;">
    -   Going into “see all” in Color Palettes will bring up various color combinations. Clicking on one will apply it to your template. Clicking on the same one again will use the same colours but apply them to different areas of the template, which will change the whole feel of the template even with the same few colours. <img src="images/26.png" alt="new slide menu" style="float:right;width:240px;margin-left:10px;">

      <button onclick="toggle('gif2')">Show / Hide Animation </button>
<div id="gif2">
      <img src="images/canva-pp2.gif">
      </div>

<script>  
    function toggle(input) {
        var x = document.getElementById(input);
        if (x.style.display === "none") {
            x.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            x.style.display = "none";
        }
    }
</script>
7.  Adding Elements:
    -   If you would like to search for more clipart, charts, or photos to add to your zine, click on the Elements icon in the far left sidebar menu.
    -   Many clipart items can have their colours customized. To edit the colours, click on the clipart in your poster to select it and then click on the colour tiles in the top menu to bring up the colour menu and select a replacement colour. 

      <button onclick="toggle('gif4')">Show / Hide Animation </button>
<div id="gif4">
      <img src="images/canva-pp4.gif">
      </div>
      
8.  Uploading Graphics: 
    -   To upload your own graphics, such as a logo or photos or your own art, click on the Uploads icon in the far left sidebar menu and then click on "Upload files" to choose the files on your computer. Once you find and select them, click on Open.
    -   Tip: High resolution PNG files with a transparent background usually work well in designs.

        <button onclick="toggle('gif5')">Show / Hide Animation </button>
<div id="gif5">
      <img src="images/canva-pp5.gif">
      </div>
      
9.  Creating a QR code is a great way to point folks to a website and further reading on your topic:<img src="images/21.png" alt="new slide menu" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;">
    -   Click on the **Apps** button in the far left navigation bar (see image).
    -   Click on the **QR Code icon** in the Create Something New section. <img src="images/22.png" alt="new slide menu" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;">
    -   Paste the URL into the white field that appears, and then click on the **Generate code button**.
    -   Move the QR code that appeared on your design to where you would like it and resize it to fit the space available.

        <button onclick="toggle('gif6')">Show / Hide Animation </button>
<div id="gif6">
      <img src="images/canva-pp6.gif">
      </div>
      
<script>  
    function toggle(input) {
        var x = document.getElementById(input);
        if (x.style.display === "none") {
            x.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            x.style.display = "none";
        }
    }
</script>
